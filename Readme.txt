These scripts perform further analysis of Magness and Makovi's data, as described in "A p-Hackers Guide to the Synthetic Control Method" by Joseph Francis.

The Master.R script will run all these scripts:

Lifecyle_analysis.R
Analyses the lifecycles of the 19 donors to Magness and Makovi's "socialists-only" Synthetic Marx.

SCM_maker_v3.R
This is an updated version of the replication of Magness and Makovi from "From Synthetic Marx to Synthetic Kafka," Econ Journal Watch, March 2025. It adds Karl Marx back into the donor pool when calculating the placebos for the permutation tests.

Socialists_only_SCM.R
Replicates the "socialists-only" Synthetic Marx, iteratively removing the leading donors.
